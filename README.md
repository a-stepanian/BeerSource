take form input and split at space and join with underscore to fetch api data for multiple word cities.

make state input field because searching buffalo showed there are multiple states with that city.

find array of state names online and use it to map the options for the state select in the form.

api returns 20 at a time, so need to dynamically determine if there is more data and then display a next page button.
