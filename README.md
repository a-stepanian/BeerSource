take form input and split at space and join with underscore to fetch api data for multiple word cities.

make state input field because searching buffalo showed there are multiple states with that city.

find array of state names online and use it to map the options for the state select in the form.

mapbox is completely different with react, have to comb through docs to use it. Also learned that environmental varibles are handled differently in react.

getting error in console from not including a key in the option tags in the find component. Added index for the mapping. This was because of iterating over an array.

api returns 20 at a time, so need to dynamically determine if there is more data and then display a next page button.
